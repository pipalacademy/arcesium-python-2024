Write a function `simple_interest` to compute simple interest. It takes three arguments, principal amount, rate of interest and time (in years) and returns simple interest accumulated on given principal amount for given number of years for given rate of interest.

```
>>> simple_interest(10000,8,5)
4000.0
>>> simple_interest(100,3,1)
3.0
```
