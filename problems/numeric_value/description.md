In financial terms a negative balance is represented with round barackets around the number instead of - sign. Write a function `numeric_value` which returns actual numeric value. For example a value "(1234)" should get -1234 as numeric value. while "34" will get value as 34
```
>>> numeric_value("(1234)")
-1234
>>> numeric_value("42")
42
```
